# Hand-Following Robot Car

## Overview

The **Hand-Following Robot Car** is an autonomous robotic vehicle that can detect and follow a nearby object (such as a hand) using **ultrasonic sensors**. The project is built using an **Arduino Uno**, **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors**, and a **L293D motor driver** to control the movement of the robot. This project demonstrates basic concepts of **robotics**, **sensor integration**, and **motor control**.

## Features
- **Object Following**: The robot can track and follow a moving hand or object based on ultrasonic distance measurement.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: It can adjust its movement and avoid obstacles based on sensor data.
- **Smooth Movement**: The car adjusts motor speeds for a stable and responsive following behavior.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller used to control the robot and process sensor data.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors**: Used to measure the distance between the robot and nearby objects.
- **L293D Motor Driver**: Used to control the DC motors of the robot based on sensor inputs.
- **DC Motors**: Used to drive the wheels of the robot.
