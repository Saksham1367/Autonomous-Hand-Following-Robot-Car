# Autonomous Hand-Following Robot Car

## Overview

The **Autonomous Hand-Following Robot Car** is a simple yet advanced robotics project that enables a robot to follow a moving hand or object using ultrasonic sensors. The project is built with **Arduino Uno** as the microcontroller, **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors** for distance measurement, and **L293D motor driver** to control the robot's movement. The car autonomously follows the detected object and avoids obstacles in its path.

## Features
- **Hand Following**: The robot follows a hand using ultrasonic sensors.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The robot detects obstacles and avoids them by changing direction.
- **Autonomous Movement**: The robot can move autonomously based on hand proximity.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno**: Microcontroller that processes sensor data and controls motors.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors**: Used for measuring distances from objects and hands.
- **L293D Motor Driver**: A dual H-Bridge motor driver used to control the DC motors.
- **DC Motors**: Used for driving the robot's wheels.
- **Robot Chassis**: A frame to hold and organize all components.
- **Jumper Wires**: For connecting components.
- **Power Supply**: A battery pack to power the Arduino and motors.

## Code Explanation

The code uses **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors** to detect the proximity of objects. If the distance is below a certain threshold, the robot will stop or change direction to avoid obstacles. The robot moves forward when no obstacle is detected.

### Key Functions:
- **moveForward()**: Moves the robot forward.
- **stopCar()**: Stops the car if an obstacle is detected.
- **getDistance()**: Measures the distance using the ultrasonic sensor.

## Wiring the Components

### 1. **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors**

The **HC-SR04** ultrasonic sensors will be used to detect the proximity of objects or hands. In this project, three sensors will be used.

| **HC-SR04 Pin**  | **Arduino Pin** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| VCC              | 5V              |
| GND              | GND             |
| Trig (Sensor 1)  | Pin 9           |
| Echo (Sensor 1)  | Pin 10          |
| Trig (Sensor 2)  | Pin 11          |
| Echo (Sensor 2)  | Pin 12          |
| Trig (Sensor 3)  | Pin 13          |
| Echo (Sensor 3)  | Pin A0          |

### 2. **L293D Motor Driver**

The **L293D** motor driver is used to control the movement of the robot by driving the motors. Connect the motor driver to the Arduino Uno as follows:

| **L293D Pin**    | **Arduino Pin** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| IN1              | Pin 3           |
| IN2              | Pin 4           |
| IN3              | Pin 5           |
| IN4              | Pin 6           |
| EN1              | 5V              |
| EN2              | 5V              |
| Motor A (Out1)   | Motor A         |
| Motor B (Out2)   | Motor B         |

- **Motor A (Out1 & Out2)**: Connect the two terminals of **DC Motor 1**.
- **Motor B (Out3 & Out4)**: Connect the two terminals of **DC Motor 2**.
- **IN1, IN2**: Control the forward and backward movement of **Motor 1**.
- **IN3, IN4**: Control the forward and backward movement of **Motor 2**.
- **EN1, EN2**: Enable the motors by connecting them to 5V to power the motors.

### 3. **DC Motors**

The **DC motors** are used to drive the wheels. Each motor is connected to the **L293D** motor driver as described above. Ensure that the motors are securely attached to the robot chassis and that they are powered through the L293D motor driver.

### 4. **Power Supply**

The **Arduino Uno** requires a power supply to operate, and the motors need a higher current for movement. You can use a **9V battery** or a **12V DC power pack** to power both the Arduino and the motors. Connect the positive terminal of the battery or power supply to the **VIN** pin on the Arduino, and connect the ground to the **GND** pin.

### 5. **Final Setup**

Once all the components are wired correctly:

- Place the **ultrasonic sensors** at the front, sides, and back of the robot to detect objects and your hand.
- Attach the **DC motors** to the wheels of the robot chassis.
- Ensure that the **L293D motor driver** is properly connected to the motors and Arduino.

Now, your robot is ready for action!

## Conclusion
