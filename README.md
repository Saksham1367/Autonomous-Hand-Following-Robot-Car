# Autonomous-Hand-Following-Robot-Car
Built a robot car that follows a nearby object using three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. Programmed the Arduino Uno to process sensor data and control motor movement via the L293D motor driver. Designed the chassis and optimized sensor placement for smooth and accurate object tracking.
